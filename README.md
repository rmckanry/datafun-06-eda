## Data Set: Electric Vehicle Population Data
```
The data set is Electric Vehicle Population Data which contains the following columns:
    VIN
    County
    City
    State
    Zip Code
    Year Make
    Model
    EV Type
    Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility
    Electric Range
    Base MSRP
    Legislative District
    DOL ID
    Vehicle Location
    Electric Utility
    2020 Census Tract

I selected this data because I am interested in EVs and own one. I plan to look at age, models, types and location to start with and continue depending on what I find with the initial analyses.
